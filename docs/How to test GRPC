To use GRPC with a local express server on port 30051:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (npm install)
2. Uncomment line 133 in test/grpcServer.js
3. npm run dev
4. npm run server-grpc
5. In Swell (dev) app, select the GRPC composer
6. Enter Stream: 0.0.0.0:30051
7. Load test proto: swell/test/hw2.proto
8. Select a service below. All of them should work.
9. Click add to workspace
10. Send! You should receive an appropriate response

Note: from my research, GRPC is mainly used between shared backend microservices so I think it would be difficult to test outside of this environment.
