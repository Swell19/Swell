/**
 * @file End-to-end testing on the electron app using Playwright
 * ****** use "npm run test-mocha" or "npm run test" to run these tests ******
 *
 * This testing suite uses Playwright to launch an instance of the Electron
 * application. Each test is in the suite below is run with a separate instance
 * of Electron, this is what setupFxn() in each of the files is. It will set up
 * Electron, and also set up functionality to screenshot the window on a failed
 * test.
 *
 * Please note many of these tests are written contingent on each other, and
 * there is room for better optimizatilson of end-to-end testing.
 *
 * @todo As of v.13, all tests should be passing EXCEPT:
 * - openAPITest()
 *
 *  Above tests are failing due to one of the following:
 * - Test-cases are no longer up-to-date with how the current UI functions
 * - Functionality in the app simply is not working as intended
 *
 * These features have incomplete and/or non-existent testing infrastructure:
 * - webRTCTest() - for read-only server input (which is the current state of the app)
 * - tRPC feature does not have E2E tests
 *
